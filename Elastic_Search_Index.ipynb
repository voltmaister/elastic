Private and public debt levels are easing as the economy rebounds from the crisis. Nonetheless, in many cases they remain above their pre-COVID-19 levels, reflecting the sharpness of the economic contraction in 2020, and the measures taken to support the economy. External rebalancing remains incomplete: the current accounts of large net-debtor countries with significant cross-border tourism sectors have improved, but remain below their pre-COVID-19 levels, while large current account surpluses in some Member States persist despite some temporary reduction during the pandemic. House prices are growing at their fastest pace in over a decade. The banking sector weathered the pandemic crisis well, although some risks might emerge as moratoria on debt repayments have ended and temporary support measures are withdrawn.\\nOverall, vulnerabilities are receding and are falling below their pre-pandemic levels in various Member States; justifying a revision of the classification of imbalances in two cases. The policy agenda embedded in the RRPs, as well as past policy action support further adjustment and stronger fundamentals for the concerned economies, delivering prospects for a continued narrowing of vulnerabilities. Economic growth will support further adjustment but countries marked by low potential growth could face challenging dynamics. Inflationary pressures are rising and tighter financing conditions and exchange rate volatility may weigh on debt servicing. This is a particular risk where private or public debt is held in foreign currencies, and where refinancing needs are substantial.\\n'],\n","     'Question': ['What are the main findings of the in-depth reviews?\\n']},\n","    '_type': 'test'},\n","   {'_id': '459',\n","    '_index': 'q&a',\n","    '_score': 3.4315937,\n","    '_source': {'Answer': [\" The Communication sets out five key principles that will guide the Commission's assessment of Member States' stability and convergence programmes and draws implications, based on the Commission 2022 winter economic forecast, for its fiscal recommendations to be proposed to Member States in May 2022 for their budgetary plans for 2023.
